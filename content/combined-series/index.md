These were part of an attempt to complete an assignment for a Computer Vision class where we were trying to combine images using a LaPlacian Pyramid to achieve different amounts of blending with different (i.e. high, medium, and low frequency) components of the image.

Clearly my code was not quite correct, but I forget exactly how each of these got messed up.

Combined I and II are attempts to recreate the [Apple and Orange image](https://becominghuman.ai/image-blending-using-laplacian-pyramids-2f8e9982077f) that seems to be a pretty standard example of this type of image blending. Notice how the blend isnt just a hard cut between the images, but the higher frequency textures (like the dimples in the orange) bleed over slightly into the apple's side of the image as the color changes beneath them.

Combined III is an attempt to do something similar, except with two images of a forest scene shot in different seasons, making it appear as though youre looking through some kind of lens into another time.
